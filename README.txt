#hilo game
hilo and risk go hand and hand. You will recieve a card number and you 
guess if the next card is higher or lower. You gain 100 if you guess 
correctly and you lose 75 points if your guess is wrong. You do not want
to get to 0... because game over.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 hilo_main 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
